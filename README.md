## **📌 Description**  
Are **ambitious people pickier in dating?** Do **fun-loving people say "yes" more often?** Do **highly attractive people reject more dates?**  

This project explores **how personality traits influence dating selectivity**, analyzing whether people with certain traits tend to have **higher standards and fewer matches**. Using real speed dating data, we aim to uncover:  
- **Which personality traits are linked to higher selectivity?**  
- **Do more attractive people reject more dates?**  
- **Are ambitious people less likely to match due to high expectations?**

## **🎯 Goals**  
- **Analyze how personality traits relate to dating selectivity.**  
- **Compare expected vs. actual matches to measure pickiness.**  
- **Identify whether attractiveness, ambition, intelligence, or fun predicts match likelihood.**

Data visualization will be used to highlight trends:  
- **Scatter plots** → Selectivity vs. personality traits.  
- **Box plots** → Differences in pickiness across groups.  
- **Bar charts** → Match rates based on personality traits.
